                            Easily one of the most recognised and popular breed of cat is the Persian. This breed actually has a very old history where they have been at the centre of civilization since they were first introduced into Europe in the 17th century. Up until the late 19th century the breeding of cats with long hair from Turkey, Afghanistan and Persia were classified as Asiatic cats and were commonly bred together. Today they have been bred to keep their very unique look which is a round head, short face, snub nose, chubby cheeks, rounded ears and big eyes.

                            The Maine Coon is a native New England breed that hailed from Maine. They were a very popular farm cat, mouser and most likely a ship cat up until the early 19th century. This breed is very good natured and adapts well too many different lifestyles and personalities. They like people being around them but they aren‚Äôt necessarily clingy. The mouser trait has still been passed down for many generations so expect your home to be rodent free.

                            Ragdolls are very smart and with enough positive reinforcement can quickly pick up tricks and good habits such as scratching posts. This particular breed is fairly new compared to the other breeds as it was first developed by a breeder in the 1960s. They love people and like what their name suggests they simply collapse in your arms when you pick them up. Even if they are cradled on their back, they love a good cuddle and scratch from anyone. They generally stay on the same level as people rather than being at the highest point in the room.

                            The Siamese cat is the pinnacle of sophistication as they look like they are all dressed up for a masquerade ball. If you live in an apartment or house that doesn‚Äôt allow for pets good luck trying to hide a Siamese as they are very talkative and opinionated. While they are extremely fond of people, they will definitely tell you what they are thinking in a very loud and raspy tone and expect you to wait on them when the call. They do require attention and play time so if you are on the go all the time this may not be the right breed for you.

                            The British shorthair is iconic in pop culture being the breed that was featured as puss in boots from Shrek and the Cheshire Cat of Alice in Wonderland. It is obliviously an English breed and has been the pinnacle of the pedigree since the Victorian era. They are very mellow and easy going making them a wonderful addition to any family. They love some affection but doesn‚Äôt whinge non-stop when you don‚Äôt give them love for 2 seconds.
